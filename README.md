**Honesty check - what runs today:** Scenarios, faults, delivery to a server and the 26 tests are real. The geometry is **illustrative**, not a model of the real LD2450 radar, and nothing here has been compared with real hardware.

---

## 🎯 Overview

* **Scenarios:** `patrol`, `crossing`, `two-intruders` and `empty`, on a three-sensor corner geometry, plus a day/night light cycle or a fixed night.
* **Repeatable faults:** a silent node, out-of-order and duplicated messages, a flapping node, and deliberately invalid messages (lux over the limit, unknown field, too many tracks) for negative tests.
* **Deterministic:** the same seed always prints the same lines; nothing is sent unless you give `--server-url` and `--ingest-token`.
* **Checked against the contract:** `--validate` runs every message through ARMOR-COMMON before it is emitted.
* **Careful delivery:** only a plain http(s) origin is accepted; a 4xx stops the run, a 5xx or a network error is retried.
* **Solar equipment:** `--solar` adds an inverter and a two-module battery stack (fifteen cells each, capacities included) over a fast day of 240 samples, with a mains outage late in the day; the messages are checked against the solar contract of ARMOR-COMMON and delivered to `/api/v1/solar`.
